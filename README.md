Welcome to project1, the GitHub repository for our DSE5002 class, where we embark on a journey that weaves data science inquiry with the rich tapestry of symbolic interpretation. This space is dedicated to unraveling the ways in which signs and symbols have been employed throughout history to shape belief and authority, a theme explored not only by Jordan Maxwell but also by thinkers like Alan Watts, who regarded language and symbol as veils over direct experience. As George Eliot writes in Silas Marner, "The past becomes dreamy because its symbols have all vanished, and the present too is dreamy because it is linked with no memories," suggesting that the erosion of symbolic continuity affects both memory and identity. In this light, education becomes more than the acquisition of technique; it becomes a kind of awakening, a process of tuning one’s awareness to the deeper architectures of meaning that structure our collective lives. As Tolstoy wrote, "Истинное образование — это не количество знаний, а качество души," which reminds us that true education is not the sum of knowledge but the character of the soul.

In project1 we take this scholarly curiosity one step further by grounding our symbolic investigation within the structured phases of a data science pipeline, as emphasized in our course materials. Beginning with a clear articulation of the CEO’s problem—how to competitively compensate a data scientist in a volatile global market—we identify and refine relevant questions through exploratory framing. Guided by ethical considerations, we examine data representing salaries, employment types, and geographic factors. By applying supervised learning models, including logistic regression, we can surface latent patterns such as how job title and remote ratio influence compensation across locations. Aggregation and visualization practices will help communicate our insights effectively, building toward a final recommendation that is not only actionable but deeply informed by both statistical precision and interpretive depth. This methodology, rooted in storytelling and iterative refinement, ensures that the symbolic becomes practical, and the abstract, measurable.
